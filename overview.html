						<h2>Summary</h2>
						<p>
							Brilliant and engagingly written, Why
							Nations Fail answers the question that has stumped
							the
							experts for centuries: Why are some nations rich and
							others poor, divided by wealth and poverty, health
							and
							sickness, food and famine?
						</p>
						<p>
							Is it culture, the weather, geography? Perhaps
							ignorance
							of what the right policies are?
						</p>
						<p>
							Simply, no. None of these factors is either
							definitive
							or destiny. Otherwise, how to explain why Botswana
							has
							become one of the fastest growing countries in the
							world, while other African nations, such as
							Zimbabwe, the Congo, and Sierra Leone, are mired in
							poverty and violence?
						</p>
						<p>
							<a href="authors.html#daron">Daron Acemoglu</a> and
							<a href="authors.html#james">James A.
								Robinson</a> conclusively show that it
							is man-made political and economic
							institutions that underlie economic success (or lack
							of it). Korea, to take
							just one of their fascinating
							examples, is a remarkably
							homogeneous nation, yet the people
							of North Korea are among
							the poorest on earth while their
							brothers and sisters in
							South Korea are among the richest.
							The south forged a
							society that created incentives,
							rewarded innovation, and
							allowed everyone to participate in
							economic opportunities.
						</p>
						<p>
							The economic success thus spurred was sustained
							because
							the government became accountable and responsive to
							citizens and the great mass of people. Sadly, the
							people of the north have endured decades of famine,
							political repression, and very different economic
							institutions—with no end in sight.
							The differences between the Koreas is due to the
							politics that created these completely different
							institutional trajectories.
						</p>
						<p>Based on fifteen years of original research Acemoglu
							and
							Robinson marshall extraordinary historical evidence
							from
							the Roman Empire, the Mayan city-states, medieval
							Venice, the Soviet Union, Latin America, England,
							Europe, the United States, and Africa to build a new
							theory of political economy with great relevance for
							the big questions of today, including:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>China has built an authoritarian growth machine.
								Will it continue to grow at such high speed and
								overwhelm the West?
							</li>
							<li>
								Are America&apos;s best days behind it? Are we
								moving from a virtuous circle in which efforts
								by elites to aggrandize power are resisted to a
								vicious one that enriches and empowers a small
								minority?
							</li>
							<li>
								What is the most effective way to help move
								billions
								of people from the rut of poverty to prosperity?
								More philanthropy from the wealthy nations of
								the West? Or learning the hard-won lessons of
								Acemoglu and Robinson&apos;s breakthrough ideas
								on the interplay between inclusive political and
								economic institutions?
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Why Nations Fail will change the way you look at—and
							understand—the world.
						</p>

						<h2>Preface</h2>
						<p>
							This book is about the huge differences in incomes
							and
							standards of living that separate the rich countries
							of the world, such as the United States, Great
							Britain, and Germany, from the poor, such as those
							in
							sub-Saharan Africa, Central America, and South Asia.
						</p>
						<p>
							As we write this preface, North Africa and the
							Middle
							East have been shaken by the “Arab Spring” started
							by the so-called Jasmine Revolution, which was
							initially ignited by public outrage over the
							selfimmolation of a street vendor, Mohamed Bouazizi,
							on December 17, 2010. By January 14, 2011,
							President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who had ruled
							Tunisia since 1987, had stepped down, but far
							from abating, the revolutionary fervor against the
							rule
							of privileged elites in Tunisia was getting stronger
							and had already spread to the rest of the Middle
							East. Hosni Mubarak, who had ruled Egypt with a
							tight
							grip for almost thirty years, was ousted on February
							11, 2011. The fates of the regimes in Bahrain,
							Libya, Syria, and Yemen are unknown as we complete
							this
							preface.
						</p>
						<p>
							The roots of discontent in these countries lie in
							their
							poverty. The average Egyptian has an income level of
							around 12 percent of the average citizen of the
							United States and can expect to live ten fewer
							years; 20
							percent of the population is in dire poverty. Though
							these differences are significant, they
							are actually quite small compared with those between
							the
							United States and the poorest countries in the
							world, such as North Korea, Sierra Leone, and
							Zimbabwe,
							where well over half the population lives in
							poverty.
						</p>
						<p>
							Why is Egypt so much poorer than the United States?
							What
							are the constraints that keep Egyptians from
							becoming more prosperous? Is the poverty of Egypt
							immutable, or can it be eradicated? A natural way to
							start thinking about this is to look at what the
							Egyptians themselves are saying about the problems
							they face and why they rose up against the Mubarak
							regime. Noha Hamed, twenty-four, a worker at an
							advertising agency in Cairo, made her views clear as
							she demonstrated in Tahrir Square: “We are suffering
							from corruption, oppression and bad education. We
							are living amid a corrupt system which has
							to change.” Another in the square, Mosaab El Shami,
							twenty, a pharmacy student,
							concurred: “I hope
							that by the end of this year we will have an elected
							government and that
							universal freedoms are applied and that we put an
							end to
							the
							corruption that has
							taken over this country.” The protestors in Tahrir
							Square
							spoke with one voice
							about the corruption of the government, its
							inability to
							deliver public
							services, and the lack of equality of opportunity in
							their
							country. They
							particularly complained about repression and the
							absence
							of
							political rights. As
							Mohamed ElBaradei, former director of the
							International
							Atomic Energy Agency,
							wrote on Twitter on January 13, 2011, “Tunisia:
							repression +
							absence of social
							justice + denial of channels for peaceful change = a
							ticking
							bomb.” Egyptians
							and Tunisians both saw their economic problems as
							being
							fundamentally caused by
							their lack of political rights. When the protestors
							started
							to formulate their
							demands more systematically, the fi rst twelve
							immediate
							demands posted by Wael
							Khalil, the software engineer and blogger who
							emerged as
							one
							of the leaders of
							the Egyptian protest movement, were all focused on
							political
							change. Issues such
							as raising the minimum wage appeared only among the
							transitional demands that
							were to be implemented later.
						</p>
						<p>
							To Egyptians, the things that have held them back
							include
							an
							ineffective and
							corrupt state and a society where they cannot use
							their
							talent, ambition,
							ingenuity, and what education they can get. But they
							also
							recognize that the
							roots of these problems are political. All the
							economic
							impediments they face
							stem from the way political power in Egypt is
							exercised
							and
							monopolized by a
							narrow elite. This, they understand, is the fi rst
							thing
							that has to change.
						</p>
						<p>
							Yet, in believing this, the protestors of Tahrir
							Square
							have
							sharply diverged
							from the conventional wisdom on this topic. When
							they
							reason
							about why a country
							such as Egypt is poor, most academics and
							commentators
							emphasize completely
							different factors. Some stress that Egypt&apos;s
							poverty is
							determined primarily by
							its geography, by the fact that the country is
							mostly a
							desert and lacks
							adequate rainfall, and that its soils and climate do
							not
							allow productive
							agriculture. Others instead point to cultural
							attributes
							of
							Egyptians that are
							supposedly inimical to economic development and
							prosperity.
							Egyptians, they
							argue, lack the same sort of work ethic and cultural
							traits
							that have allowed
							others to prosper, and instead have accepted Islamic
							beliefs
							that are
							inconsistent with economic success. A third
							approach,
							the
							one dominant among
							economists and policy pundits, is based on the
							notion
							that
							the rulers of Egypt
							simply don&apos;t know what is needed to make their
							country
							prosperous, and have
							followed incorrect policies and strategies in the
							past.
							If
							these rulers would
							only get the right advice from the right advisers,
							the
							thinking goes, prosperity
							would follow. To these academics and pundits, the
							fact
							that
							Egypt has been ruled
							by narrow elites feathering their nests at the
							expense
							of
							society seems
							irrelevant to understanding the country&apos;s
							economic
							problems.
						</p>
						<p>
							In this book we&apos;ll argue that the Egyptians in
							Tahrir
							Square,
							not most academics
							and commentators, have the right idea. In fact,
							Egypt is
							poor precisely because
							it has been ruled by a narrow elite that have
							organized
							society for their own
							benefit at the expense of the vast mass of people.
							Political power has been
							narrowly concentrated, and has been used to create
							great
							wealth for those who
							possess it, such as the $70 billion fortune
							apparently
							accumulated by
							ex-president Mubarak. The losers have been the
							Egyptian
							people, as they only too
							well understand.
						</p>
						<p>
							We&apos;ll show that this interpretation of Egyptian
							poverty,
							the
							people&apos;s
							interpretation, turns out to provide a general
							explanation
							for why poor
							countries are poor. Whether it is North Korea,
							Sierra
							Leone,
							or Zimbabwe, we&apos;ll
							show that poor countries are poor for the same
							reason
							that
							Egypt is poor.
							Countries such as Great Britain and the United
							States
							became
							rich because their
							citizens overthrew the elites who controlled power
							and
							created a society where
							political rights were much more broadly distributed,
							where
							the government was
							accountable and responsive to citizens, and where
							the
							great
							mass of people could
							take advantage of economic opportunities. We&apos;ll
							show
							that to
							understand why
							there is such inequality in the world today we have
							to
							delve
							into the past and
							study the historical dynamics of societies.
							We&apos;ll see
							that
							the reason that
							Britain is richer than Egypt is because in 1688,
							Britain
							(or
							England, to be
							exact) had a revolution that transformed the
							politics
							and
							thus the economics of
							the nation. People fought for and won more political
							rights,
							and they used them
							to expand their economic opportunities. The result
							was a
							fundamentally different
							political and economic trajectory, culminating in
							the
							Industrial Revolution.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Industrial Revolution and the technologies it
							unleashed didn&apos;t spread to
							Egypt, as that country was under the control of the
							Ottoman
							Empire, which
							treated Egypt in rather the same way as the Mubarak
							family
							later did. Ottoman
							rule in Egypt was overthrown by Napoleon Bonaparte
							in
							1798,
							but the country then
							fell under the control of British colonialism, which
							had
							as
							little interest as
							the Ottomans in promoting Egyp&apos;s prosperity.
							Though the
							Egyptians shook off the
							Ottoman and British empires and, in 1952, overthrew
							their
							monarchy, these were
							not revolutions like that of 1688 in England, and
							rather
							than fundamentally
							transforming politics in Egypt, they brought to
							power
							another elite as
							disinterested in achieving prosperity for ordinary
							Egyptians
							as the Ottoman and
							British had been. In consequence, the basic
							structure of
							society did not change,
							and Egypt stayed poor.
						</p>
						<p>
							In this book we&apos;ll study how these patterns
							reproduce
							themselves over time and
							why sometimes they are altered, as they were in
							England
							in
							1688 and in France
							with the revolution of 1789. This will help us to
							understand
							if the situation in
							Egypt has changed today and whether the revolution
							that
							overthrew Mubarak will
							lead to a new set of institutions capable of
							bringing
							prosperity to ordinary
							Egyptians. Egypt has had revolutions in the past
							that
							did
							not change things,
							because those who mounted the revolutions simply
							took
							over
							the reins from those
							they&apos;d deposed and re-created a similar system.
							It is
							indeed
							difficult for
							ordinary citizens to acquire real political power
							and
							change
							the way their
							society works. But it is possible, and we&apos;ll
							see how
							this
							happened in England,
							France, and the United States, and also in Japan,
							Botswana,
							and Brazil.
							Fundamentally it is a political transformation of
							this
							sort
							that is required for
							a poor society to become rich. There is evidence
							that
							this
							may be happening in
							Egypt. Reda Metwaly, another protestor in Tahrir
							Square,
							argued, “Now you see
							Muslims and Christians together, now you see old and
							young
							together, all wanting
							the same thing.” We&apos;ll see that such a broad
							movement in
							society was a key part
							of what happened in these other political
							transformations.
							If we understand when
							and why such transitions occur, we will be in a
							better
							position to evaluate when
							we expect such movements to fail as they have often
							done
							in
							the past and when we
							may hope that they will succeed and improve the
							lives of
							millions.
