                        about national income
                        differences within the modern world, perhaps the
                        biggest problem facing the
                        world today. It’s peppered with fascinating stories
                        that will make you a

                        the authoritarian ‘extractive’ institutions like the
                        ones that drive growth in

                        is impossible, because only a

                        It explains huge swathes of human history. It is
                        equally at home in Asia, Africa

                        the past as it gives us a new way to think about the
                        present. It is that rare
                        book in economics that convinces the reader that the
                        authors want the best for

                        shifts in direction created by contingent historical
                        events, large and small at
                        ‘critical junctures.’ Acemoglu and Robinson provide
                        an enormous range of
                        historical examples to show how such shifts can tilt
                        toward favorable
                        institutions, progressive innovation and economic
                        success or toward repressive
                        institutions and eventual decay or stagnation.
                        Somehow they can generate both

                        compelling explanation for why so many countries

                        elites rig the rules to
                        benefit themselves at the expense of the many.
                        Charting a careful course between

                        demonstrate history and geography need
                        not be destiny. But they also document how sensible
                        economic ideas and policies
                        often achieve little in the absence of fundamental
